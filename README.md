# Introduction
Repo for my unity game, No Ground. Holds entire project. To run, clone
entire repo, and open using unity HUB.


# Game Description
WIP -> will update as new features get added and released
Randomly generated levels, made up of randomly generated block clusters.
3 different general types of worlds (flat, cube, tall)
 - each world type has majority clusters made up of that type of block
     - still contains a small number of the other two just to break up
 - each block has multiple child blocks adding texture and detail
 - main play area contains 3 main cluster levels of blocks with clouds in between
     - some layers will have blocks in them because of randomness


# Feature Progress
See project attached to this repo to see progress and lined up features. Also contains more detail
on the features currently under development.
